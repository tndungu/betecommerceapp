# Bet Ecommerce App

A complete Ecommerce Application build using React. The backend is built using .NET Core 6.0 Framework and MS SQL Server. The Backend with setup instructions is available at the [Backend API Repository](https://github.com/tndungu/BetEcommerceApi.git). Performance improvement has been done using infinite scroll which ensures fast display of records where there are large datasets.

## Tools

This project is primarily built in React 17.0 and REDUX for State Management. Others include 
- React Hooks
- Bootstrap 5
- React-router-dom
- Formik
- Material-UI icons among other npm packages.
The dependencies will be included in the project after running npm install.

## Local Setup
1. Clone the Repository using the following command:
   `git clone https://github.com/tndungu/betecommerceapp.git`
2. Open the Repository using your favorite text editor. I use Visual Studio Code as a personal preference.
3. Open terminal and run the following:

 4. Run the project using npm start. This will open the project in http://localhost:3000
